# CV generator

This is a very simple CV generator for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-react-new-cv-application).

It is my first project using React.

Some notable features:

- Optimized for desktop and mobile.
- Uses immer for simplified state updates.
- I've paid special attention to making the form accessible using focus styles and tab order.
- CSS rules at component level where possible.

A linter warning for prop type checking is surpressed, because this discussed later in the Odin curriculum.
